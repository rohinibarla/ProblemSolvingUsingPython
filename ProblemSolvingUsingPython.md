# Problem solving using Python

We will use Python language as a medium to learn problem solving in computing domain.

No prior programming experience is required to do this course.

In this course with a set of constraints and projects we have created an environment for you to experience problem solving. The learning outcomes are subjective based on the amount of exploration you do in this environment.

At a broder level, the outcomes for everyone completing the course are, you will become comfortable in programming. Given enough time, you can solve any computing problem. In 2 weeks time you will be able to learn any new language. An understanding of system internals like when you execute your program, how the control flows in the system and how the data flows in the system and life-cycle of different resources in the system.

The projects folder contains n projects. The first one is for setup and configuration verification purpose.

Projects:
00 - Setup end to end. Use existing commands.
01 - Creating new commands.
02 - Creating fundamental commands.
03 - Using your commands to build higher level functionality. Verifying your commands' correctness with test cases.
04 - Ordered collection of data.
05 - Create graphical display functionality.
06 - Simple expression evaluator, with two operators.
07 -
