# 01: Creating new functions

Create four new functions for computing prev, negative, double and triple of given number.

Create new functions using the following functions only.

- e42_add
- e42_subtract
- e42_show

You can create the new functions using the existing ones.
For example to create a new function _e42_next_

We have used en42_add with the given number and 1. Which will result in the increment of the number.

For now take the first line as rule, which is given for all the functions you need to create.

```python
def e42_next(number):
    result = e42_add(number, 1)
    return result
```

Similarly you need to create new function _e42_negative_.
See the sample functions e42_next, inorder to create the new functions.

```python
def e42_negative(number):
    result = 0
    return result
```

Once done, check that the output for e42_negative.

Similarly create the functions e42_double and e42_triple.

---

## So far the rules are

You can use the following three functions only

- e42_add
- e42_subtract
- e42_show

The first line for creating new functions is fixed like this

```python
def e42_negative(number):
```

The last line for creating new functions is fixed like this

```python
    return result
```
